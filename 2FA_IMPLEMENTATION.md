# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation for Mobile App

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in the HoopayApp mobile application. The implementation follows the same security standards as the web version and provides a seamless user experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 2FA Challenge During Login
- **Screen**: `TwoFactorChallengeScreen.tsx`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Appears when users with 2FA enabled attempt to log in
  - Supports both 6-digit TOTP codes and recovery codes
  - Session timeout (5 minutes) for security
  - Toggle between authenticator codes and recovery codes

### 2. 2FA Setup Screen
- **Screen**: `TwoFactorSetupScreen.tsx`
- **Functionality**:
  - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - Manual secret key entry option
  - Step-by-step setup process
  - Verification and enablement
  - Display of recovery codes after setup

### 3. 2FA Management Screen
- **Screen**: `TwoFactorManagementScreen.tsx`
- **Functionality**:
  - View current 2FA status
  - Enable/disable 2FA
  - View recovery codes
  - Regenerate recovery codes
  - Security tips and guidelines

### 4. Backend API Integration
- **Service**: `twoFactorService.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/mobile/2fa/status` - Get 2FA status
  - `/mobile/2fa/generate` - Generate QR code and secret
  - `/mobile/2fa/verify-enable` - Verify and enable 2FA
  - `/mobile/2fa/disable` - Disable 2FA
  - `/mobile/2fa/recovery-codes` - Get recovery codes
  - `/mobile/2fa/recovery-codes/regenerate` - Regenerate recovery codes
  - `/mobile/2fa/verify-login` - Verify 2FA during login

## Security Features

### 1. TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- Uses Google2FA library (same as web version)
- 6-digit codes with 30-second validity
- Compatible with Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy

### 2. Recovery Codes
- 8 unique recovery codes generated per user
- Each code can only be used once
- Automatically removed after use
- Can be regenerated with password confirmation

### 3. Password Verification
- All sensitive operations require password confirmation
- Prevents unauthorized changes even if device is compromised

### 4. Session Management
- 5-minute timeout for 2FA challenge sessions
- Secure token handling with JWT

## User Flow

### Enabling 2FA
1. User navigates to 2FA Management from Profile
2. Clicks "Enable 2FA" 
3. QR code is generated and displayed
4. User scans QR code with authenticator app
5. User enters 6-digit verification code
6. User enters current password for confirmation
7. 2FA is enabled and recovery codes are displayed
8. User saves recovery codes securely

### Login with 2FA
1. User enters email and password
2. Backend detects 2FA is enabled
3. User is redirected to 2FA Challenge screen
4. User enters 6-digit code from authenticator app
5. Or user can toggle to use recovery code
6. Upon successful verification, user is logged in

### Managing 2FA
1. User navigates to 2FA Management
2. Can view current status
3. Can view/copy recovery codes
4. Can regenerate recovery codes (requires password)
5. Can disable 2FA (requires password)

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Service Updates
- Modified `auth.ts` to handle 2FA responses
- Added `needs2FA` property to AuthResponse interface
- Updated login flow to redirect to 2FA challenge

### Navigation Integration
- Add routes for 2FA screens:
  ```javascript
  // In your navigation stack
  <Stack.Screen name="TwoFactorChallenge" component={TwoFactorChallengeScreen} />
  <Stack.Screen name="TwoFactorSetup" component={TwoFactorSetupScreen} />
  <Stack.Screen name="TwoFactorManagement" component={TwoFactorManagementScreen} />
  ```

### Profile Integration
Add 2FA management option to the profile screen:
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigation.navigate('TwoFactorManagement')}>
  <Text>Two-Factor Authentication</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Login Screen Updates
The login screen automatically handles 2FA redirects when the backend returns `needs2FA: true`.

## Dependencies
- `react-native-qrcode-svg`: QR code generation and display
- `@expo/vector-icons`: Icons for UI
- `react-native-animatable`: Smooth animations
- `expo-linear-gradient`: Gradient backgrounds

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Storage
- 2FA secrets are encrypted in the database
- Recovery codes are encrypted and hashed
- No sensitive data stored on the client device

### 2. Network Security
- All API calls use HTTPS
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Password verification for sensitive operations

### 3. User Experience
- Clear error messages
- Timeout handling
- Smooth transitions between states
- Offline graceful degradation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Enable 2FA with QR code scanning
- [ ] Enable 2FA with manual secret entry
- [ ] Login with 2FA code
- [ ] Login with recovery code
- [ ] View recovery codes
- [ ] Regenerate recovery codes
- [ ] Disable 2FA
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Error handling for invalid codes
- [ ] Password verification flows

### Integration Points
- Ensure backend APIs are properly configured
- Test with different authenticator apps
- Verify email notifications (if implemented)
- Test on both iOS and Android devices

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Biometric 2FA**: Integration with device biometrics
2. **SMS 2FA**: Alternative to TOTP for users without smartphones
3. **Hardware Keys**: Support for FIDO2/WebAuthn keys
4. **Backup Methods**: Multiple authenticator devices
5. **Admin Features**: Force 2FA for all users
6. **Analytics**: 2FA adoption and usage metrics

### Maintenance
- Regular security audits
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Monitor for new authentication standards
- User feedback integration

## Support and Documentation

### User Help
